### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: September 27, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** Started my first project, the CGPA calculator. Update: also finished the calculator.

**Thoughts:** Felt good to finally start coding again, and c++ so far is very similar to syntax and languages I'm already used to like C and Java.

**Link to work:** [GeeksForGeeks 50 C++ Projects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-cpp-project-ideas-for-beginners-advanced/) (I hope to complete all 50 of these projects, or at least all of the beginner and intermediate ones. The expert ones may be too time consuming to complete them all, at least during the duration of the challenge.)

### Day 2: September 28, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Started and finished my second project: rock, paper, scissors game against random cpu answers.

**Thoughts:** Felt just as good as yesterday, I can't wait to get into more complicated projects.

**Work:** Project 2.

### Day 3: September 29, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Set up C++ on my mac and started project 3.

**Thoughts:** Didn't have much time to code today but I still managed to code a bit towards project 3 - the casino guessing game - and before that I had to make sure my mac was setup towards coding in c++ since I was coding on windows before. Setting up c++ admittedly took longer than expected because I was also trying to install homebrew and then add it to my path so I could easily install g++, but what I didn't realize was that I think I had clang++ the whole time... regardless it's done now and I am using g++. I hope to finish or at least make solid progress on project 3 tomorrow.

**Work:** Project 3.

### Day 4: September 30, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Basically finished project 3.

**Thoughts:** I am writing this short log the day after since I forgot to the day of, but I did get some work done yesterday and made some real progress towards the casino game. Part of the project is utilizing different classes and I may have overstepped some of my knowledge trying to implement them in different roles which caused difficulty. Tomorrow I hope to remedy those issues and finish the project.

**Work:** Project 3.

### Day 5: October 1, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Actually finished project 3 and started project 4.

**Thoughts:** Started pretty late today, but I decided for the 3rd project from yesterday to just move the second class to the same file and deal with the issue when it is more necessary like with a harder / bigger project. Also found out why my randomly generated answers were the same every time. I didn't have a lot of time today because I started so late and more importantly I am finding myself slipping a bit and finding it harder to code in my freetime, likely because of fatigue maybe caused by my new job. However, I hope to schedule some dedicated coding time after work to help myself stay in the rhythm. Project 4 looks to be both harder and easier than I had previously expected before planning for it. Also started logging on the other log file (this one) because I liked this template better. I likely will not log in both files because the redundancy is unnecessary.

**Work:** Projects 3 and 4.

### Day 6: October 3, 2024

**Today's Progress:** REALLY started project 4 by making a gameplan and getting some very basic functionality down.

**Thoughts:** I had to use a skip yesterday because I was having a really rough time and thought it was best if I take time to rest due to all of that personal stuff. While I am ultimately not happy with this event or even my progress today, I am still proud of myself and happy that I was able to sit down and get anything done at all. This project is already a challenge and I plan on beating it.

**Work:** Project 4

### Day 7: October 4, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Still very slow today. I did not really accomplish much more towards the project since last time.

**Thoughts:** I really gave it a good effort towards putting time and thought into the project today, but I think the reality of my lack of progress is I'm simply stuck on this problem and my best chance at solving it is probably going to involve breaking the project down into smaller and deeper steps so I can understand it better.

**Work:** Project 4

# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 27, 2024].

For the beginning of my journey to learn and create with C++, I will be utilizing the projects outlined by a GeeksForGeeks article as a guideline: <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-50-cpp-project-ideas-for-beginners-advanced/>. 

## Log

### R1D1 
Started my first project, the CGPA calculator.
Update: also finished the calculator.

### R1D2
Started and finished my second project: rock, paper, scissors game against random cpu answers.

### R1D3
Didn't have much time to code today but I still managed to code a bit towards project 3 - the casino guessing game - and before that I had to make sure my mac was setup towards coding in c++ since I was coding on windows before. Setting up c++ admittedly took longer than expected because I was also trying to install homebrew and then add it to my path so I could easily install g++, but what I didn't realize was that I think I had clang++ the whole time... regardless it's done now and I am using g++. I hope to finish or at least make solid progress on project 3 tomorrow.

### R1D4
I am writing this short log the day after since I forgot to the day of, but I did get some work done yesterday and made some real progress towards the casino game. Part of the project is utilizing different classes and I may have overstepped some of my knowledge trying to implement them in different roles which caused difficulty. Tomorrow I hope to remedy those issues and finish the project.
